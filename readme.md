Game engine built with SDL3::GPU (Early stages - WIP)

- Only tested in MacOs / METAL so far (use shadercross to cross compile shaders to other platforms)
- Minimal libraries (SDL3, nalgebra, stb_image)
- Support for hot-realoading the game .dll
- Sprite batcher (to minimise draw calls)
- Multiple shaders/material support 
- Custom Immediate mode GUI (WIP)
- Next up: ECS
